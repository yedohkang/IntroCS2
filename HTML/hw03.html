<h3> <i> Background </i> </h3>

<body> <p> <b> Stuyvesant High School </b> is one of the eight specialized high schools in the city. It is the hardest school to get into, and it's pretty obvious why. This school offers so many opportunities and classes, and even extracurriculars. </p> <p> Many core classes are offered, as well as many AP classes. A lot of electives are offered as well, such as Vertebrate Zoology and Molecular Genetics. </p> <p> There are over 40 sports teams and more than 200 student-run clubs as well as general extracurriculars. There are many student-run productions, such as SING!, STC shows, and Stuy Squad. </p> <p> Even the student body is amazing. Even though our school may be made up of 70% Asian students, there's so much in store for everybody. With around 900 students per grade, it is impossible to not make a new friend. </p> </body>
