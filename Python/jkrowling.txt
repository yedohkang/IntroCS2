Sorry to disappoint you and all that, 
but the greatest wizard in the world is 
Albus Dumbledore. Everyone says so. Even 
when you were strong, you didn't dare try 
and take over at Hogwarts. Dumbledore saw 
through you when you were at school and he 
still frightens you now, wherever you're hiding
these days
