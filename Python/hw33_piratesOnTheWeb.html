    Everyday when you be walkin' down t' street
And everybody that ye meet
Has an original point of view

And me say HEY! (HEY! )
What a wonderful kind of day! 
If ye can learn to work and play
And get along with each other

Ye got to listen to yers heart
Listen to t' beat
Listen to t' rhythm
The rhythm of t' street
Open up yers eyes
Open up yers ears
Get together and make things better
By workin' together! 

It's a simple message and it comes from t' heart
Believe in yourself (in yourself)
cause that's t' place to start (to start)

And me say HEY! (HEY! )
What a wonderful kind of day
If we can learn to work and play
And get along with each other! Arrr! 
Hey what a wonderful kind of day hey!
