Everyday when you're walking down the street \n
And everybody that you meet \n
Has an original point of view \n
\n \n
And I say HEY! (HEY!) \n
What a wonderful kind of day. \n
If you can learn to work and play \n
And get along with each other \n
\n \n 
You got to listen to your heart \n
Listen to the beat \n
Listen to the rhythm \n
The rhythm of the street \n
Open up your eyes \n
Open up your ears \n
Get together and make things better \n
By working together! \n
\n \n
It's a simple message and it comes from the heart \n
Believe in yourself (in yourself) \n
cause that's the place to start (to start) \n
\n \n
And I say HEY! (HEY!) \n
What a wonderful kind of day \n
If we can learn to work and play \n
And get along with each other. \n
Hey what a wonderful kind of day hey! \n
